    <h1>Iquitos Peru</h1>
    <p>Iquitos is the largest city in the Peruvian Amazon and is often called the “capital of the Amazon.” It is unique
        because
        it is one of the world's largest cities that cannot be reached by road; instead, visitors must arrive by boat or
        plane.
        Surrounded by rivers and lush rainforest, Iquitos is a gateway to exploring the Amazon's incredible
        biodiversity. The
        city itself is lively, with a mix of Indigenous, Spanish, and modern influences, and it is known for its
        floating
        neighborhood of Belén, colorful markets, and eco-tourism.</p>
